## 🎯 Goal

This project began as an extension of The Odin Project's task list challenge, evolving into a full-featured Trello-style application. The goal was to tackle UI complexity, DOM architecture, and user experience in a larger-scale frontend project — without relying on libraries or frameworks.

## ⚙️ How it Works

- Create an unlimited number of **boards**, each with its own name and background.
- Inside each board, add **columns** freely and fill them with **cards**.
- Cards include a name, description, and a color label for quick visual identification.
- All elements are **fully editable** via a custom **modal system**.
- The UI includes **toast notifications** to handle feedback, errors, and actions.
- Boards are **persisted in local storage** and can be **exported as JSON**.
- Drag and drop is implemented using the native HTML API, with custom enhancements:
  - Cards, columns and boards are **fully reorderable**.
  - A **custom ghost image** replaces the default drag preview for a cleaner, branded interaction.
  - Elements include **visual feedback while dragging** for improved UX.
- Includes a collapsible sidebar panel for quick access to features.
- No backend, no loading times, and all data remains private on your machine.
